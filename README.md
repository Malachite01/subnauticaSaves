# <h1><img src="subnauticaSync.ico" style="width: 50px;">  subnauticaSaves : </h1> &ensp; Is a small batch script, used to synchronize the saves of the game subnautica (EpicGames version) via a Git repository. This tool can also be modified to synchronize all types of files and folders: you just have to specify the path to the folder you want to save and the link to your git repository.
<br><br>

<h2>Setup : </h2> &ensp; 
<br>- Create a Git repository, <b><ins>WITHOUT A README.md</ins></b>
<br>- Placing the script in the folder that should be saved is not mandatory, but strongly recommended as external files will be created.
<br>- Run the script and enter the link to your Git repository inside the Prompt window. 
<br>- Inside the next window, enter the path to the folder that you want to save and sync.
<br>- Running the script will automatically synchronize your repository, or, in case running the script for the first time, send all your files and create all of the configuration files needed for the script.
<br>- In case the configuration is deleted or not found in the folder, the creations steps will be repeated.
<br><br>

<h2>Usage : </h2> &ensp; To synchronize, you will need to run the application before starting a session, and at the end of a session to send the save to the repository. <b><ins>Do not forget to run the tool if the game has been started, even if it is only for a short time and no progress has been made in the game.</ins></b>
<br><br>

<h2>Style : </h2> &ensp; It is also possible to create a shortcut and change the icon with the one available in the repository "subnauticaSync.ico".
